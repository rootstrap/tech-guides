# SOLIDITY

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

Solidity is a curly-bracket language. It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). You can find more details about which languages Solidity has been inspired by in the language influences section.

# SPDX LICENSE IDENTIFIER

Trust in smart contract can be better established if their source code is available. Since making source code available always touches on legal problems with regards to copyright, the Solidity compiler encourages the use of machine-readable SPDX license identifiers. Every source file should start with a comment indicating its license:

[// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT]

# PRAGMA AND VERSIONS

The pragma keyword is used to enable certain compiler features or checks The version of the pragma will anounce that will accepts some words, functions, and more elements of the languages.


# ESTRUCUTURE OF SMART CONTRACTS

Contracts in Solidity are similar to classes in object-oriented languages. Each contract can contain declarations of: 
State Variables,
Functions,
Function Modifiers, 
Events, Errors, 
Struct Types,
Enum Types.
Furthermore, contracts can inherit from other contracts.
