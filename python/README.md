## Introduction

This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution. Please see the companion informational PEP describing style guidelines for the C code in the C implementation of Python [1].

This document and PEP 257 (Docstring Conventions) were adapted from Guido's original Python Style Guide essay, with some additions from Barry's style guide [2].

This style guide evolves over time as additional conventions are identified and past conventions are rendered obsolete by changes in the language itself.

Many projects have their own coding style guidelines. In the event of any conflicts, such project-specific guides take precedence for that project.

## A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds

One of Guido's key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written. The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. As PEP 20 says, "Readability counts".

A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important.

However, know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes style guide recommendations just aren't applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask!

In particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with this PEP!

Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline:

When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP.
To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for historic reasons) -- although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else's mess (in true XP style).
Because the code in question predates the introduction of the guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying that code.
When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of Python that don't support the feature recommended by the style guide.

## Code Lay-out

### Indentation

Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent [7]. When using a hanging indent the following should be considered; there should be no arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line.

Yes:

```python
# Aligned with opening delimiter.
foo = long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four,
)
```

# More indentation included to distinguish this from the rest.

```python
def long_function_name(
        var_one, var_two, var_three,
        var_four):
    print(var_one)

# Hanging indents should add a level.
foo = long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four,
)
```

No:

```python
# Arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)

# Further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable.
def long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two, var_three,
    var_four):
    print(var_one)
The 4-space rule is optional for continuation lines.
```

Optional:

```python
# Hanging indents *may* be indented to other than 4 spaces.
foo = long_function_name(
  var_one, var_two,
  var_three, var_four,
)
```

When the conditional part of an if-statement is long enough to require that it be written across multiple lines, it's worth noting that the combination of a two character keyword (i.e. if), plus a single space, plus an opening parenthesis creates a natural 4-space indent for the subsequent lines of the multiline conditional. This can produce a visual conflict with the indented suite of code nested inside the if-statement, which would also naturally be indented to 4 spaces. This PEP takes no explicit position on how (or whether) to further visually distinguish such conditional lines from the nested suite inside the if-statement. Acceptable options in this situation include, but are not limited to:

```python
# No extra indentation.
if (this_is_one_thing and
    that_is_another_thing):
    do_something()

# Add a comment, which will provide some distinction in editors
# supporting syntax highlighting.
if (this_is_one_thing and
    that_is_another_thing):
    # Since both conditions are true, we can frobnicate.
    do_something()

# Add some extra indentation on the conditional continuation line.
if (this_is_one_thing
        and that_is_another_thing):
    do_something()
(Also see the discussion of whether to break before or after binary operators below.)
```

The closing brace/bracket/parenthesis on multiline should be lined up under the first character of the line that starts the multiline construct, as in:

```python
my_list = [
    1, 2, 3,
    4, 5, 6,
]
result = some_function_that_takes_arguments(
    'a', 'b', 'c',
    'd', 'e', 'f',
)
```

### Tabs or Spaces?
Spaces are the preferred indentation method.

Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.

Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation.

Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively.

When invoking the Python 2 command line interpreter with the -t option, it issues warnings about code that illegally mixes tabs and spaces. When using -tt these warnings become errors. These options are highly recommended!

### Maximum Line Length

Limit all lines to a maximum of 119 characters for Django projects and 79 for python projects in general.

Usually Django lines are longer due to queries and urls that need to be placed entirely on a line and for that reason in
those projects a longer line length is preferred.
Keep in mind tough that if you want to open source a project later, shortening the line length is advisable.

For flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 80 characters.

Limiting the required editor window width makes it possible to have several files open side-by-side, and works well when using code review tools that present the two versions in adjacent columns.

The default wrapping in most tools disrupts the visual structure of the code, making it more difficult to understand. The limits are chosen to avoid wrapping in editors with the window width set to 80, even if the tool places a marker glyph in the final column when wrapping lines. Some web based tools may not offer dynamic line wrapping at all.

Some teams strongly prefer a longer line length. For code maintained exclusively or primarily by a team that can reach agreement on this issue, it is okay to increase the nominal line length from 80 to 100 characters (effectively increasing the maximum length to 99 characters), provided that comments and docstrings are still wrapped at 72 characters.

The Python standard library is conservative and requires limiting lines to 79 characters (and docstrings/comments to 72).

The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python's implied line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces. Long lines can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in parentheses. These should be used in preference to using a backslash for line continuation.

Backslashes may still be appropriate at times. For example, long, multiple with-statements cannot use implicit continuation, so backslashes are acceptable:

```python
with open('/path/to/some/file/you/want/to/read') as file_1, \
     open('/path/to/some/file/being/written', 'w') as file_2:
    file_2.write(file_1.read())
(See the previous discussion on multiline if-statements for further thoughts on the indentation of such multiline with-statements.)
```

Another such case is with assert statements.

Make sure to indent the continued line appropriately.

### Should a Line Break Before or After a Binary Operator?

For decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators. But this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get scattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is moved away from its operand and onto the previous line. Here, the eye has to do extra work to tell which items are added and which are subtracted:

# No: operators sit far away from their operands
income = (gross_wages +
          taxable_interest +
          (dividends - qualified_dividends) -
          ira_deduction -
          student_loan_interest)
To solve this readability problem, mathematicians and their publishers follow the opposite convention. Donald Knuth explains the traditional rule in his Computers and Typesetting series: "Although formulas within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations, displayed formulas always break before binary operations" [3].

Following the tradition from mathematics usually results in more readable code:

```python
# Yes: easy to match operators with operands
income = (gross_wages
          + taxable_interest
          + (dividends - qualified_dividends)
          - ira_deduction
          - student_loan_interest)
```
In Python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary operator, as long as the convention is consistent locally. For new code Knuth's style is suggested.

### Blank Lines

Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.

Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

Python accepts the control-L (i.e. ^L) form feed character as whitespace; Many tools treat these characters as page separators, so you may use them to separate pages of related sections of your file. Note, some editors and web-based code viewers may not recognize control-L as a form feed and will show another glyph in its place.

### Source File Encoding

Code in the core Python distribution should always use UTF-8 (or ASCII in Python 2).

Files using ASCII (in Python 2) or UTF-8 (in Python 3) should not have an encoding declaration.

In the standard library, non-default encodings should be used only for test purposes or when a comment or docstring needs to mention an author name that contains non-ASCII characters; otherwise, using \x, \u, \U, or \N escapes is the preferred way to include non-ASCII data in string literals.

For Python 3.0 and beyond, the following policy is prescribed for the standard library (see PEP 3131): All identifiers in the Python standard library MUST use ASCII-only identifiers, and SHOULD use English words wherever feasible (in many cases, abbreviations and technical terms are used which aren't English). In addition, string literals and comments must also be in ASCII. The only exceptions are (a) test cases testing the non-ASCII features, and (b) names of authors. Authors whose names are not based on the Latin alphabet (latin-1, ISO/IEC 8859-1 character set) MUST provide a transliteration of their names in this character set.

Open source projects with a global audience are encouraged to adopt a similar policy.

### Imports

* Imports should usually be on separate lines:

```python
Yes: import os
     import sys

No:  import sys, os
```

It's okay to say this though:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
```

* Imports are always put at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants.

Imports should be grouped in the following order:

1. Standard library imports.
2. Related third party imports.
3. Local application/library specific imports.
You should put a blank line between each group of imports.

* Absolute imports are recommended, as they are usually more readable and tend to be better behaved (or at least give better error messages) if the import system is incorrectly configured (such as when a directory inside a package ends up on sys.path):

```python
import mypkg.sibling
from mypkg import sibling
from mypkg.sibling import example
```

However, explicit relative imports are an acceptable alternative to absolute imports, especially when dealing with complex package layouts where using absolute imports would be unnecessarily verbose:

```python
from . import sibling
from .sibling import example
```

Standard library code should avoid complex package layouts and always use absolute imports.

Implicit relative imports should never be used and have been removed in Python 3.

* When importing a class from a class-containing module, it's usually okay to spell this:

```python
from myclass import MyClass
from foo.bar.yourclass import YourClass
```

If this spelling causes local name clashes, then spell them explicitly:

```python
import myclass
import foo.bar.yourclass
```

and use `"myclass.MyClass"` and `"foo.bar.yourclass.YourClass"`.

* Wildcard imports (`from <module> import *`) should be avoided, as they make it unclear which names are present in the namespace, confusing both readers and many automated tools. There is one defensible use case for a wildcard import, which is to republish an internal interface as part of a public API (for example, overwriting a pure Python implementation of an interface with the definitions from an optional accelerator module and exactly which definitions will be overwritten isn't known in advance).

When republishing names this way, the guidelines below regarding public and internal interfaces still apply.

### Module Level Dunder Names

Module level "dunders" (i.e. names with two leading and two trailing underscores) such as `__all__`, `__author__`, `__version__`, etc. should be placed after the module docstring but before any import statements except from `__future__` imports. Python mandates that future-imports must appear in the module before any other code except docstrings:

```python
"""This is the example module.

This module does stuff.
"""

from __future__ import barry_as_FLUFL

__all__ = ['a', 'b', 'c']
__version__ = '0.1'
__author__ = 'Cardinal Biggles'

import os
import sys
```

## String Quotes

In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the same. This PEP does not make a recommendation for this. Pick a rule and stick to it. When a string contains single or double quote characters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the string. It improves readability.

For triple-quoted strings, always use double quote characters to be consistent with the docstring convention in [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257).

Here at Rootstrap we prefer to use single-quoted strings over double quotes.
For docstrings we use double quotes since the chance of writing a ' is higher in the documentation string of a class or a method

## Whitespace in Expressions and Statements

### Pet Peeves

Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:

* Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces.

```python
Yes: spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})
No:  spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )
```

Between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis.

```python
Yes: foo = (0,)
No:  bar = (0, )
```

* Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon:

```python
Yes: if x == 4: print x, y; x, y = y, x
No:  if x == 4 : print x , y ; x , y = y , x
```

* However, in a slice the colon acts like a binary operator, and should have equal amounts on either side (treating it as the operator with the lowest priority). In an extended slice, both colons must have the same amount of spacing applied. Exception: when a slice parameter is omitted, the space is omitted.

Yes:

```python
ham[1:9], ham[1:9:3], ham[:9:3], ham[1::3], ham[1:9:]
ham[lower:upper], ham[lower:upper:], ham[lower::step]
ham[lower+offset : upper+offset]
ham[: upper_fn(x) : step_fn(x)], ham[:: step_fn(x)]
ham[lower + offset : upper + offset]
```

No:

```python
ham[lower + offset:upper + offset]
ham[1: 9], ham[1 :9], ham[1:9 :3]
ham[lower : : upper]
ham[ : upper]
```

* Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument list of a function call:

```python
Yes: spam(1)
No:  spam (1)
```

* Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts an indexing or slicing:

```python
Yes: dct['key'] = lst[index]
No:  dct ['key'] = lst [index]
```

More than one space around an assignment (or other) operator to align it with another.

Yes:

```python
x = 1
y = 2
long_variable = 3
```

No:

```python
x             = 1
y             = 2
long_variable = 3
```

### Other Recommendations

* Avoid trailing whitespace anywhere. Because it's usually invisible, it can be confusing: e.g. a backslash followed by a space and a newline does not count as a line continuation marker. Some editors don't preserve it and many projects (like CPython itself) have pre-commit hooks that reject it.

* Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (`=`), augmented assignment (`+=`, `-=` etc.), comparisons (`==`, `<`, `>`, `!=`, `<>`, `<=`, `>=`, `in`, `not in`, `is`, `is not`), Booleans (`and`, `or`, `not`).

* If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies). Use your own judgment; however, never use more than one space, and always have the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator.

Yes:

```python
i = i + 1
submitted += 1
x = x*2 - 1
hypot2 = x*x + y*y
c = (a+b) * (a-b)
```

No:

```python
i=i+1
submitted +=1
x = x * 2 - 1
hypot2 = x * x + y * y
c = (a + b) * (a - b)
```

* Function annotations should use the normal rules for colons and always have spaces around the -> arrow if present. (See [Function Annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-annotations) below for more about function annotations.)

Yes:

```python
def munge(input: AnyStr): ...
def munge() -> AnyStr: ...
```

No:

```python
def munge(input:AnyStr): ...
def munge()->PosInt: ...
```

* Don't use spaces around the = sign when used to indicate a keyword argument, or when used to indicate a default value for an unannotated function parameter.

Yes:

```python
def complex(real, imag=0.0):
    return magic(r=real, i=imag)
```

No:

```python
def complex(real, imag = 0.0):
    return magic(r = real, i = imag)
```

* When combining an argument annotation with a default value, however, do use spaces around the = sign:

Yes:

```python
def munge(sep: AnyStr = None): ...
def munge(input: AnyStr, sep: AnyStr = None, limit=1000): ...
```

No:

```python
def munge(input: AnyStr=None): ...
def munge(input: AnyStr, limit = 1000): ...
```

* Compound statements (multiple statements on the same line) are generally discouraged.

Yes:

```python
if foo == 'blah':
    do_blah_thing()
do_one()
do_two()
do_three()
```

Rather not:

```python
if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()
do_one(); do_two(); do_three()
```

* While sometimes it's okay to put an if/for/while with a small body on the same line, never do this for multi-clause statements. Also avoid folding such long lines!

Rather not:

```python
if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()
for x in lst: total += x
while t < 10: t = delay()
```

Definitely not:

```python
if foo == 'blah': do_blah_thing()
else: do_non_blah_thing()

try: something()
finally: cleanup()


do_one(); do_two(); do_three(long, argument,
                             list, like, this)

if foo == 'blah': one(); two(); three()
```

## When to Use Trailing Commas

Trailing commas are usually optional, except they are mandatory when making a tuple of one element (and in Python 2 they have semantics for the `print` statement). For clarity, it is recommended to surround the latter in (technically redundant) parentheses.

Yes:

```python
FILES = ('setup.cfg',)
```

OK, but confusing:

```python
FILES = 'setup.cfg',
```

When trailing commas are redundant, they are often helpful when a version control system is used, when a list of values, arguments or imported items is expected to be extended over time. The pattern is to put each value (etc.) on a line by itself, always adding a trailing comma, and add the close parenthesis/bracket/brace on the next line. However it does not make sense to have a trailing comma on the same line as the closing delimiter (except in the above case of singleton tuples).

Yes:

```python
FILES = [
    'setup.cfg',
    'tox.ini',
    ]
initialize(FILES,
           error=True,
           )
```

No:

```python
FILES = ['setup.cfg', 'tox.ini',]
initialize(FILES, error=True,)
```

## Comments

Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments. Always make a priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes!

Comments should be complete sentences. The first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter (never alter the case of identifiers!).

Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of complete sentences, with each sentence ending in a period.

You should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period in multi- sentence comments, except after the final sentence.

When writing English, follow Strunk and White.

Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please write your comments in English, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never be read by people who don't speak your language.


### Block Comments

Block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows them, and are indented to the same level as that code. Each line of a block comment starts with a # and a single space (unless it is indented text inside the comment).

Paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line containing a single #.


### Inline Comments

Use inline comments sparingly.

An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement. Inline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement. They should start with a # and a single space.

Inline comments are unnecessary and in fact distracting if they state the obvious. Don't do this:

```python
x = x + 1                 # Increment x
```

But sometimes, this is useful:

```python
x = x + 1                 # Compensate for border
```

### Documentation Strings

Conventions for writing good documentation strings (a.k.a. "docstrings") are immortalized in [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257).

* Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods. Docstrings are not necessary for non-public methods, but you should have a comment that describes what the method does. This comment should appear after the def line.

* [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257) describes good docstring conventions. Note that most importantly, the `"""` that ends a multiline docstring should be on a line by itself:

```python
"""Return a foobang

Optional plotz says to frobnicate the bizbaz first.
"""
```

* For one liner docstrings, please keep the closing """ on the same line.

## Naming Conventions

The naming conventions of Python's library are a bit of a mess, so we'll never get this completely consistent -- nevertheless, here are the currently recommended naming standards. New modules and packages (including third party frameworks) should be written to these standards, but where an existing library has a different style, internal consistency is preferred.

### Overriding Principle

Names that are visible to the user as public parts of the API should follow conventions that reflect usage rather than implementation.

### Descriptive: Naming Styles

There are a lot of different naming styles. It helps to be able to recognize what naming style is being used, independently from what they are used for.

The following naming styles are commonly distinguished:

* `b` (single lowercase letter)

* `B` (single uppercase letter)

* `lowercase`

* `lower_case_with_underscores`

* `UPPERCASE`

* `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`

* `CapitalizedWords` (or CapWords, or CamelCase -- so named because of the bumpy look of its letters [4]). This is also sometimes known as StudlyCaps.

Note: When using acronyms in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the acronym. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError.

* `mixedCase` (differs from CapitalizedWords by initial lowercase character!)

* `Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores` (ugly!)

There's also the style of using a short unique prefix to group related names together. This is not used much in Python, but it is mentioned for completeness. For example, the `os.stat()` function returns a tuple whose items traditionally have names like `st_mode`, `st_size`, `st_mtime` and so on. (This is done to emphasize the correspondence with the fields of the POSIX system call struct, which helps programmers familiar with that.)

The X11 library uses a leading X for all its public functions. In Python, this style is generally deemed unnecessary because attribute and method names are prefixed with an object, and function names are prefixed with a module name.

In addition, the following special forms using leading or trailing underscores are recognized (these can generally be combined with any case convention):

* `_single_leading_underscore`: weak "internal use" indicator. E.g. `from M import *` does not import objects whose name starts with an underscore.

* `single_trailing_underscore_`: used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword, e.g.

```python
Tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_='ClassName')
```

* `__double_leading_underscore`: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside `class FooBar`, `__boo` becomes `_FooBar__boo`; see below).

* `__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__`: "magic" objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. `__init__`, `__import__ or __file__`. Never invent such names; only use them as documented.

### Prescriptive: Naming Conventions

#### Names to Avoid

Never use the characters `'l'` (lowercase letter el), `'O'` (uppercase letter oh), or `'I'` (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.

In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero. When tempted to use `'l'`, use `'L'` instead.

#### ASCII Compatibility
Identifiers used in the standard library must be ASCII compatible as described in the policy section of [PEP 3131](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131).

#### Package and Module Names

Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.

When an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying Python module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented) interface, the C/C++ module has a leading underscore (e.g. `_socket`).

#### Class Names

Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.

The naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where the interface is documented and used primarily as a callable.

Note that there is a separate convention for builtin names: most builtin names are single words (or two words run together), with the CapWords convention used only for exception names and builtin constants.

#### Type Variable Names

Names of type variables introduced in [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) should normally use CapWords preferring short names: T, AnyStr, Num. It is recommended to add suffixes `_co` or `_contra` to the variables used to declare covariant or contravariant behavior correspondingly:

```python
from typing import TypeVar

VT_co = TypeVar('VT_co', covariant=True)
KT_contra = TypeVar('KT_contra', contravariant=True)
```

#### Exception Names

Because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention applies here. However, you should use the suffix "Error" on your exception names (if the exception actually is an error).

#### Global Variable Names

(Let's hope that these variables are meant for use inside one module only.) The conventions are about the same as those for functions.

Modules that are designed for use via `from M import *` should use the `__all__` mechanism to prevent exporting globals, or use the older convention of prefixing such globals with an underscore (which you might want to do to indicate these globals are "module non-public").

#### Function and Variable Names

Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.

Variable names follow the same convention as function names.

mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.

#### Function and Method Arguments

Always use `self` for the first argument to instance methods.

Always use `cls` for the first argument to class methods.

If a function argument's name clashes with a reserved keyword, it is generally better to append a single trailing underscore rather than use an abbreviation or spelling corruption. Thus `class_` is better than `clss`. (Perhaps better is to avoid such clashes by using a synonym.)

#### Method Names and Instance Variables

Use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.

Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables.

To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python's name mangling rules.

Python mangles these names with the class name: if class Foo has an attribute named `__a`, it cannot be accessed by `Foo.__a`. (An insistent user could still gain access by calling `Foo._Foo__a`.) Generally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed.

Note: there is some controversy about the use of `__names` (see below).

#### Constants

Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include `MAX_OVERFLOW` and `TOTAL`.

#### Designing for Inheritance

Always decide whether a class's methods and instance variables (collectively: "attributes") should be public or non-public. If in doubt, choose non-public; it's easier to make it public later than to make a public attribute non-public.

Public attributes are those that you expect unrelated clients of your class to use, with your commitment to avoid backwards incompatible changes. Non-public attributes are those that are not intended to be used by third parties; you make no guarantees that non-public attributes won't change or even be removed.

We don't use the term "private" here, since no attribute is really private in Python (without a generally unnecessary amount of work).

Another category of attributes are those that are part of the "subclass API" (often called "protected" in other languages). Some classes are designed to be inherited from, either to extend or modify aspects of the class's behavior. When designing such a class, take care to make explicit decisions about which attributes are public, which are part of the subclass API, and which are truly only to be used by your base class.

With this in mind, here are the Pythonic guidelines:

* Public attributes should have no leading underscores.

* If your public attribute name collides with a reserved keyword, append a single trailing underscore to your attribute name. This is preferable to an abbreviation or corrupted spelling. (However, notwithstanding this rule, 'cls' is the preferred spelling for any variable or argument which is known to be a class, especially the first argument to a class method.)

Note 1: See the argument name recommendation above for class methods.

* For simple public data attributes, it is best to expose just the attribute name, without complicated accessor/mutator methods. Keep in mind that Python provides an easy path to future enhancement, should you find that a simple data attribute needs to grow functional behavior. In that case, use properties to hide functional implementation behind simple data attribute access syntax.

Note 1: Properties only work on new-style classes.

Note 2: Try to keep the functional behavior side-effect free, although side-effects such as caching are generally fine.

Note 3: Avoid using properties for computationally expensive operations; the attribute notation makes the caller believe that access is (relatively) cheap.

* If your class is intended to be subclassed, and you have attributes that you do not want subclasses to use, consider naming them with double leading underscores and no trailing underscores. This invokes Python's name mangling algorithm, where the name of the class is mangled into the attribute name. This helps avoid attribute name collisions should subclasses inadvertently contain attributes with the same name.

Note 1: Note that only the simple class name is used in the mangled name, so if a subclass chooses both the same class name and attribute name, you can still get name collisions.

Note 2: Name mangling can make certain uses, such as debugging and __getattr__(), less convenient. However the name mangling algorithm is well documented and easy to perform manually.

Note 3: Not everyone likes name mangling. Try to balance the need to avoid accidental name clashes with potential use by advanced callers.

### Public and Internal Interfaces

Any backwards compatibility guarantees apply only to public interfaces. Accordingly, it is important that users be able to clearly distinguish between public and internal interfaces.

Documented interfaces are considered public, unless the documentation explicitly declares them to be provisional or internal interfaces exempt from the usual backwards compatibility guarantees. All undocumented interfaces should be assumed to be internal.

To better support introspection, modules should explicitly declare the names in their public API using the `__all__` attribute. Setting `__all__` to an empty list indicates that the module has no public API.

Even with `__all__` set appropriately, internal interfaces (packages, modules, classes, functions, attributes or other names) should still be prefixed with a single leading underscore.

An interface is also considered internal if any containing namespace (package, module or class) is considered internal.

Imported names should always be considered an implementation detail. Other modules must not rely on indirect access to such imported names unless they are an explicitly documented part of the containing module's API, such as os.path or a package's `__init__` module that exposes functionality from submodules.

## Programming Recommendations

* Code should be written in a way that does not disadvantage other implementations of Python (PyPy, Jython, IronPython, Cython, Psyco, and such).

For example, do not rely on CPython's efficient implementation of in-place string concatenation for statements in the form `a += b` or `a = a + b`. This optimization is fragile even in CPython (it only works for some types) and isn't present at all in implementations that don't use refcounting. In performance sensitive parts of the library, the `''.join()` form should be used instead. This will ensure that concatenation occurs in linear time across various implementations.

* Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with is or is not, never the equality operators.

Also, beware of writing `if x` when you really mean `if x is not None` -- e.g. when testing whether a variable or argument that defaults to `None` was set to some other value. The other value might have a type (such as a container) that could be false in a boolean context!

* Use `is not` operator rather than `not ... is`. While both expressions are functionally identical, the former is more readable and preferred.

Yes:

```python
if foo is not None:
```

No:

```python
if not foo is None:
```

When implementing ordering operations with rich comparisons, it is best to implement all six operations (`__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`) rather than relying on other code to only exercise a particular comparison.

To minimize the effort involved, the `functools.total_ordering()` decorator provides a tool to generate missing comparison methods.

[PEP 207](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0207) indicates that reflexivity rules are assumed by Python. Thus, the interpreter may swap `y > x` with `x < y`, `y >= x` with `x <= y`, and may swap the arguments of `x == y` and `x != y`. The sort() and min() operations are guaranteed to use the < operator and the max() function uses the > operator. However, it is best to implement all six operations so that confusion doesn't arise in other contexts.

* Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier.

Yes:

```python
def f(x): return 2*x
```

No:

```python
f = lambda x: 2*x
```

The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is specifically 'f' instead of the generic '<lambda>'. This is more useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda expression can offer over an explicit def statement (i.e. that it can be embedded inside a larger expression)

* Derive exceptions from `Exception` rather than `BaseException`. Direct inheritance from BaseException is reserved for exceptions where catching them is almost always the wrong thing to do.

Design exception hierarchies based on the distinctions that code catching the exceptions is likely to need, rather than the locations where the exceptions are raised. Aim to answer the question "What went wrong?" programmatically, rather than only stating that "A problem occurred" (see [PEP 3151](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3151) for an example of this lesson being learned for the builtin exception hierarchy)

Class naming conventions apply here, although you should add the suffix `Error` to your exception classes if the exception is an error. Non-error exceptions that are used for non-local flow control or other forms of signaling need no special suffix.

* Use exception chaining appropriately. In Python 3, `raise X from Y` should be used to indicate explicit replacement without losing the original traceback.

When deliberately replacing an inner exception (using `raise X` in Python 2 or `raise X from None` in Python 3.3+), ensure that relevant details are transferred to the new exception (such as preserving the attribute name when converting `KeyError` to `AttributeError`, or embedding the text of the original exception in the new exception message).

* When raising an exception in Python 2, use `raise ValueError('message')` instead of the older form `raise ValueError, 'message'`.

The latter form is not legal Python 3 syntax.

The paren-using form also means that when the exception arguments are long or include string formatting, you don't need to use line continuation characters thanks to the containing parentheses.

* When catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever possible instead of using a bare except: clause:

```python
try:
    import platform_specific_module
except ImportError:
    platform_specific_module = None
```

A bare `except:` clause will catch SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a program with Control-C, and can disguise other problems. If you want to catch all exceptions that signal program errors, use `except Exception:` (bare except is equivalent to except BaseException:).

A good rule of thumb is to limit use of bare 'except' clauses to two cases:

1. If the exception handler will be printing out or logging the traceback; at least the user will be aware that an error has occurred.

2. If the code needs to do some cleanup work, but then lets the exception propagate upwards with raise. try...finally can be a better way to handle this case.
When binding caught exceptions to a name, prefer the explicit name binding syntax added in Python 2.6:

```python
try:
    process_data()
except Exception as exc:
    raise DataProcessingFailedError(str(exc))
```

This is the only syntax supported in Python 3, and avoids the ambiguity problems associated with the older comma-based syntax.

* When catching operating system errors, prefer the explicit exception hierarchy introduced in Python 3.3 over introspection of errno values.

* Additionally, for all try/except clauses, limit the try clause to the absolute minimum amount of code necessary. Again, this avoids masking bugs.

Yes:

```python
try:
    value = collection[key]
except KeyError:
    return key_not_found(key)
else:
    return handle_value(value)
```
No:

```python
try:
    # Too broad!
    return handle_value(collection[key])
except KeyError:
    # Will also catch KeyError raised by handle_value()
    return key_not_found(key)
```

* When a resource is local to a particular section of code, use a `with` statement to ensure it is cleaned up promptly and reliably after use. A try/finally statement is also acceptable.

* Context managers should be invoked through separate functions or methods whenever they do something other than acquire and release resources.

Yes:

```python
with conn.begin_transaction():
    do_stuff_in_transaction(conn)
```

No:

```python
with conn:
    do_stuff_in_transaction(conn)
```

The latter example doesn't provide any information to indicate that the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods are doing something other than closing the connection after a transaction. Being explicit is important in this case.

* Be consistent in return statements. Either all return statements in a function should return an expression, or none of them should. If any return statement returns an expression, any return statements where no value is returned should explicitly state this as return None, and an explicit return statement should be present at the end of the function (if reachable).

Yes:

```python
def foo(x):
    if x >= 0:
        return math.sqrt(x)
    else:
        return None

def bar(x):
    if x < 0:
        return None
    return math.sqrt(x)
```

No:

```python
def foo(x):
    if x >= 0:
        return math.sqrt(x)

def bar(x):
    if x < 0:
        return
    return math.sqrt(x)
```

* Use string methods instead of the string module.

String methods are always much faster and share the same API with unicode strings. Override this rule if backwards compatibility with Pythons older than 2.0 is required.

* Use `''.startswith()` and `''.endswith()` instead of string slicing to check for prefixes or suffixes.

`startswith()` and `endswith()` are cleaner and less error prone:

```python
Yes: if foo.startswith('bar'):
No:  if foo[:3] == 'bar':
```

* Object type comparisons should always use isinstance() instead of comparing types directly.

```python
Yes: if isinstance(obj, int):
No:  if type(obj) is type(1):
```

When checking if an object is a string, keep in mind that it might be a unicode string too! In Python 2, str and unicode have a common base class, basestring, so you can do:

```python
if isinstance(obj, basestring):
```

Note that in Python 3, unicode and basestring no longer exist (there is only `str`) and a bytes object is no longer a kind of string (it is a sequence of integers instead).

* For sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences are false.

```python
Yes: if not seq:
     if seq:
```

```python
No:  if len(seq):
     if not len(seq):
```

* Don't write string literals that rely on significant trailing whitespace. Such trailing whitespace is visually indistinguishable and some editors (or more recently, reindent.py) will trim them.

* Don't compare boolean values to True or False using `==`.

```python
Yes:   if greeting:
No:    if greeting == True:
Worse: if greeting is True:
```

### Function Annotations

With the acceptance of [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484), the style rules for function annotations are changing.

* In order to be forward compatible, function annotations in Python 3 code should preferably use [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) syntax. (There are some formatting recommendations for annotations in the previous section.)

* The experimentation with annotation styles that was recommended previously in this PEP is no longer encouraged.

* However, outside the stdlib, experiments within the rules of [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) are now encouraged. For example, marking up a large third party library or application with [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) style type annotations, reviewing how easy it was to add those annotations, and observing whether their presence increases code understandability.

* The Python standard library should be conservative in adopting such annotations, but their use is allowed for new code and for big refactorings.

* For code that wants to make a different use of function annotations it is recommended to put a comment of the form:

```python
# type: ignore
```

near the top of the file; this tells type checker to ignore all annotations. (More fine-grained ways of disabling complaints from type checkers can be found in [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484).)

* Like linters, type checkers are optional, separate tools. Python interpreters by default should not issue any messages due to type checking and should not alter their behavior based on annotations.

* Users who don't want to use type checkers are free to ignore them. However, it is expected that users of third party library packages may want to run type checkers over those packages. For this purpose [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) recommends the use of stub files: .pyi files that are read by the type checker in preference of the corresponding .py files. Stub files can be distributed with a library, or separately (with the library author's permission) through the typeshed repo [5].

* For code that needs to be backwards compatible, type annotations can be added in the form of comments. See the relevant section of [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) [6].

### Variable Annotations

[PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526) introduced variable annotations. The style recommendations for them are similar to those on function annotations described above:

* Annotations for module level variables, class and instance variables, and local variables should have a single space after the colon.

* There should be no space before the colon.

* If an assignment has a right hand side, then the equality sign should have exactly one space on both sides.

Yes:

```python
code: int

class Point:
    coords: Tuple[int, int]
    label: str = '<unknown>'
```

No:

```python
code:int  # No space after colon
code : int  # Space before colon

class Test:
    result: int=0  # No spaces around equality sign
```

Although the PEP 526 is accepted for Python 3.6, the variable annotation syntax is the preferred syntax for stub files on all versions of Python (see [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484) for details).

## Naming standards for unit tests

The basic naming of a test comprises of three main parts:

 [UnitOfWork_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior]

A unit of work is a use case in the system that startes with a method and ends up with one of three types of results: a return value/exception, a state change to the system which changes its behavior, or a call to a third party (when we use mocks). So a unit of work can be a small as a method, or as large as a class, or even multiple classes, as long is it all runs in memory, and is fully under our control.

**Examples**:

```
def test_sum_negative_number_as_1st_param_exception_thrown()

def test_sum_negative_number_as_2nd_param_exception_thrown ()

def test_sum_simple_values_calculated ()
```

###  Reasons:

#### Test name should express a specific requirement

Your unit test name should express a specific requirement. This requirement should be somehow derived from either a business requirement or a technical requirement. In any case, that requirement has been broken down into small enough pieces, each of which represents a test case. If your test is not representing a requirement, why are you writing it? Why is that code even there?

Most developers don't bother too much with writing good assert messages in their tests. A good assert message (which shows up if the test fails) is the key to understanding what went wrong. Assuming writing good assert messages is one of the key places where most unit test developers fall short, the only thing left to save us then is the name of the test.

#### Test name should include the expected input or state and the expected result for that input or state

To express the specific requirement clearly you should think about two things you need to express: the input values/current state during which the test takes place, and the expected result from that state.

Example:

Given this method:

**def sum(a, b)**

You have a requirement that numbers larger than 1000 that are passed in should not be considered for calculation (that is a number bigger than 1000 is equal to zero).

**What about this name: test_sum_number_bigger_than_1000**

That is only half way there. As a reader of the test I can only assume that some input in your test is bigger than 1000, but I do not understand what the requirement being tested is.

**How about this name: test_sum_number_is_ignored**

Still not good enough. While it does tell me the expected result, it does not tell me under which circumstances it needs to be ignored. I would have to go into the test code and read through it to find out what the expected input is.

**How about this name: test_sum_number_ignored_if_bigger_than_1000**

That is much better. I can tell just by looking at the test name what It means if the test fails. I don t need to look at the code, and I can tell exactly what requirement this test tries to solve.

#### Test name should be presented as a statement or fact of life that expresses workflows and outputs

Unit tests are just as much about documentation as they are about testing functionality. You should always assume that someone else is going to read your tests in a year, and that they should not have a hard time understanding your intent.

People might first complain that the name of the test method appears way too long for them, but in the end it s more about readability. Longer test names do not imply longer or less optimized code, and even if they did, we are not looking to optimize test code performance. If anything, test code should always be optimized for readability.

Here s an example of a bad and good test name

test_sum_negative_number()

And here s a better way to express your intent

test_sum_negative_number_as_2nd_param_exception_thrown ()

#### Test Name should only begin with Test if it is required by the testing framework or if it eases development and maintenance of the unit tests in some way.

Since most tests today reside in a specific class or module that is logically defined as a test container, there are only a handful of reasons why you would want to prefix you test methods with the word Test :

- Your unit testing framework requires this

- You have coding standards in place and they include this

#### Test name should include name of tested method or class

You usually have at least a number of tests for each method you are testing, and you are usually testing a number of methods in one test container (since you usually have a test container per class tested). This leads to the requirement that your test should also reflect the name of the method begin tested, not only the requirements from it.

For example:

**MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior**

test_sum_negative_number_as_1st_param_exception_thrown()

test_sum_negative_number_as_2nd_param_exception_thrown ()

test_sum_simple_values_calculated ()

test_parse_on_empty_string_exception_thrown()

test_parse_single_token_returns_equal_toekn_value ()

#### Naming Variables in a test:

Variable names should express the expected input and state

It s easy to name variables going into a method with generic names, but with unit tests you have to be twice as careful to name them as what they represent, i.e. BAD_DATA or EMPTY_ARRAY or NON_INITIALIZED_PERSON

A good way to check if your names are good enough is to look at the ASSERT at the end of the test method. If the ASSERT line is expressing what your requirement is, or comes close, you re probably there.

For example:

assertEqual(-1, val)

Vs.

assertEqual(BAD_INITIALIZATION_CODE, ReturnCode, 'Method shold have returned a bad initialization code')

## virtualenv

Virtualenv is used to manage Python packages for different projects. Using virtualenv allows you to avoid installing Python packages globally which could break system tools or other projects. You can install virtualenv using pip.

**Note**: if you are using Python 3.3 or newer the venv module is included in the Python standard library. This can also create and manage virtual environments, however, it only supports Python 3.

### Verify if Virtualenv is installed
There is a chance that virtualenv is already installed on your system.

Run the following command in your terminal
```
virtualenv --version
```
If you see a version number, it's already installed.

### Create a virtual environment for a project
On macOS and Linux:
```
virtualenv venv
```
Virtualenv will create a folder in the current directory which will contain python, pip, and basic libraries. The name of the virtual environment (in this case, it was venv) can be anything; omitting the name will place the files in the current directory instead.

For especify which version Python (in case you have multiple versions of Python):
```
virtualenv -p python3 <env> # Creates a new virtualenv with name env and python3
```

### Activating a virtualenv
Before you can start installing or using packages in your virtualenv you’ll need to activate it. Activating a virtualenv will put the virtualenv-specific python and pip executables into your shell’s PATH.

On macOS and Linux:
```
source ./<env>/bin/activate
```
### Leaving the virtualenv
If you want to switch projects or otherwise leave your virtualenv, simply run:
```
deactivate
```
If you want to re-enter the virtualenv just follow the same instructions above about activating a virtualenv. There’s no need to re-create the virtualenv.

### VirtualenvWrapper

Virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to virtualenv tool.
The extensions include wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies.
Features:
- Organizes all of your virtual environments in one place.
- Wrappers for managing your virtual environments (create, delete, copy).
- Use a single command to switch between environments.
- Tab completion for commands that take a virtual environment as argument.

##### NOTE:
virtualenvwrapper is a system tool so it should be installed system wide or at least user wide.
Do not try to install virtualenvwrapper iside a virtualenv because it will not work outside of such env if it works at all

Even tough this is not mandatory, this sets some defaults about virtualenv use.
You can install it with pip following this instructions.
```
$ pip install virtualenvwrapper
```
Then you should add the following lines to your .profile / .bashrc or bash_profile:
```
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3; # This is to avoid specifiying the python version every time.
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs                   # in Linux Python 3 should be the default and this line
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel                         # should not be necesary anymore.
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```
After that create the virtualenv folder with:
```
mkdir $HOME/.virtualenvs
```


This will give you a couple of handful commands for virtualenv management.
Then you should be able to make full use of virtualenv capabilities,
Here are some of the most common commands:

Create a virtualenv:
```
$ mvkvirtualenv <env>
```
Select a virtualenv to work:
```
$ workon <env>
```
List the available virtualenvs:
```
$ lsvirtualenv
```
Add some directories to the current path of the active virtualenv:
```
$ add2virtualenv <dir1> [dir2, dir3, ...]
```
for further reading you can consult the docs.

## Typing hints

Python by default is a dinamically typed language but there is also some static typed languages, for instance C and Java. However, [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) introduced typed hints, which make it possible to also do static type checking of Python code. Type hints by themselves don’t cause Python to enforce types. As the name says, type hints just suggest types. There are other tools, such as [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/), that will be discuss later in this section.

Here you will see a few examples of python code, this is how it will normally looks, no typing at all:

```python
import math

def calculate_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```

Now this is how a code with type comments will look like:

```python
import math

def calculate_circumference(radius):
    # type: (float) -> float
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```

And finally how a typed hint code will look like:

```python
import math

def calculate_circumference(radius: float) -> float:
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```

### Pros of typing hints

* Helps you catch certain errors by improving IDEs and linters.
* Helps you document your code, changes doctstrings with types to a self documented code. 
* Build and mantain a cleaner architecture. This will enforce you to think about types in your code.
* In bigger projects, type hints help you understand how types flow through your code, and are highly recommended. Even more so in projects where there is a lot of people involved.

### Cons of typing hints

* Will take developer time and effort to add it.
* Work best in modern versions of Python. Python 2.7 could use typed comments, but it was introduced in Python 3.0.
* It could introduce a slight penalty in start-up time, specially in short scripts if you need to use `import typing` module.

### Typing: please remember

This typing concepts does not mean you HAVE to use static type checking in your code, there is a concept call [Gradual typing in PEP 483](https://peps.python.org/pep-0483/#summary-of-gradual-typing). This means that you can gradually introduce types into the code. Code without type hints will be ignored by the static type checker. Therefore, you can start adding types to critical components.

# Django
To start a new Django project, we recomend to use [Django-Cookiecutter](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django). Please go to our [guide to start a Django project](./cookiecutter-django.md) using this tool.

## Suggested project scaffolding

This is the suggested scaffolding for a Django project, that is already specified in our Django-Cookiecutter guide.

## Viewsets
If you are working on a RESTful API, we recommend you to use [Django REST framework Viewsets](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/).
A Viewset abstracts the HTTP verbs GET, POST, PUT, etc, with proper resource-based operations: list, create, retrieve, update, partial_update and destroy.
Let's see an example of a definition of a Viewset in a Django project:

```python
# views.py file in myapp
from rest_framework import viewsets

from myapp.models import MyModel
from myapp.serializers import MyModelSerializer


class MyModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
```

Now let's register the Viewset:

```python
# your urls.py file in myapp
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter

from myapp.views import MyModelViewSet

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'mymodel', MyModelViewSet, base_name='mymodel')
urlpatterns = router.urls
```

This code adds a set of URLs into your urlpatterns in the form `<base_name>/`. For example:
- `GET mymodel/` will point to MyModelViewSet.list
- `POST mymodel/` will point to MyModelViewSet.create
- `GET mymodel/<id>/` will point to MyModelViewSet.retrieve to get the data from the instance of the corresponding `<id>`.
- `PUT mymodel/<id>/` will point to MyModelViewSet.update to update the instance of the corresponding `<id>`
- `DELETE mymodel/<id>/` will point to MyModelViewSet.destroy to delete the instance of the corresponding `<id>`

The default view name will be `mymodel-list` for the methods of all the instances (without `id`), and `mymodel-detail` for the methods of particular instances (with `id`).

You can even customize the permissions, and/or the use of serializers overwriting the `get_permissions` and/or the `get_serializer` functions of the MyModelViewSet class respectively, for example:

```python
...
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser
...
from myapp.serializers import ListMyModelSerializer, MyModelSerializer
...

class MyModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):  
    ...

    def get_permissions(self):
        if self.action == 'list':
            permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
        else:
            permission_classes = [IsAdminUser]
        return [permission() for permission in permission_classes]
    
    ...

    def get_serializer_class(self):
        if self.action == 'list':
            return ListMyModelSerializer
        return MyModelSerializer


```

You can also add more actions, with the `action` decorator, specifiying the available `methods` (by default is GET), and if you want to apply the action to a particular instance (`detail=True`) or all the instances (`detail=False`). Let's see an example:

```python
...
...

class MyModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):  
    ...

    @action(detail=True, methods=['post'])
    def my_action_1(self, request, pk=None):  # Needs a pk because detail=True
        ... # Some code for the action over a particular instance

    @action(detail=False)  # By default is the GET action, there's no pk because detail=False
    def my_action_2(self, request):
        ...  # Some code for the action over all the instances (you can customize the set of instances)
    
    ...
```

The `action` decorator also allows to set `permission_classes` for a particular action. For example:

```python
    ... # ModelViewSet class
    @action(detail=True, methods=['put'], permission_classes=[IsAdminOrIsSelf])
    def my_action_3(self, request, pk=None):
        ...
```

Following the previous examples of actions in viewsets, we can affirm that they will be available in the next URLs:
- `my_action_1`: `mymodel/<id>/my_action_1/` and the default name: `mymodel-my-action-1`
- `my_action_2`: `mymodel/my_action_2/` and the default name: `mymodel-my-action-2`

Besides, it's possible to change these default values, specifying `url_path` and `url_name` in the action decorator. For example:

```python
    ... # ModelViewSet class
    @action(methods=['post'], detail=True, url_path='my-path', url_name='my_url_name')
    def my_action_4(self, request, pk=None):
        ...
    ...
```

Will generate this URL path: `mymodel/<id>/my-path` and this URL name: `mymodel-my_url_name`

## Deploy to Heroku (First time)
If you have created the project with Django-Cookiecutter and you want to deploy the project in Heroku[7], you can follow these
steps:

1. Go to the Heroku Dashboard and create a new app (Clicking on New/Create new app). If this is a deploy for the production environment, make sure you are in the client's organization.
2. Open the created app in Heroku and go to the Resources tab. Then add the corresponding addons (examples: Heroku-Postgres, Heroku-Redis, etc).
3. Go to the Settings tab of the app in Heroku and click on Reveal Config Vars. Add there all the mandatory env vars. Examples of the most common needed env vars:
  - `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
  - `DJANGO_ADMIN_URL` (For security reasons don't set the admin path as `/admin/`. Use a random generated value)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (If you use the Heroku-Postgres addon, this env var is automatically added by Heroku)
  - `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` (set it for production config file)
  - `DJANGO_DEBUG` (set it to False)
  - `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (set it to the host name of the app)
4. On your computer, go to the project folder on the terminal and add the git repository URL of the app as a remote repository: `git remote add <remote-name> <heroku-app-url>`
5. Then go to the branch you want to deploy with git: `git checkout <my-branch>`
6. Push the branch to the remote repository recently added: `git push <remote-name> <my-branch>`
7. If everything goes well, you have done the first deploy to Heroku of your Django project. Now you can integrate the app in the Heroku Dashboard, by opening the app, then clicking on the Deploy tab, then selecting Github in the Deploy method section, and then choosing the Github project. After this, if you want to make a new deploy:
   1. Go to the Deploy tab in your app on the Heroku Dashboard.
   2. In Manual Deploy, write the name of the branch you want to deploy.
   3. Click on Deploy Branch button.

Notes
- To see the remote URL in heroku, go to the project, Settings tab, and check the `Heroku git URL` value.
- You can generate a value for the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` env var with the command: `openssl rand -base64 64`
- You can generate a value for the `DJANGO_ADMIN_URL` env var with the command: `openssl rand -base64 4096 | tr -dc 'A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z2-9' | head -c 32`
